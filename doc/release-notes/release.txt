MAP-Tk v0.10.1 Release Notes
============================

This release provides patches to the MAP-Tk v0.10.0 release to address issues.
MAP-Tk v0.10.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v0.10.0
--------------------

Build System

 * The CPack installer packaging was broken on MacOS due to using the variable
   CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX instead of CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX to find
   KWIVER plugins to include in the package.  These variables are the same on
   most platforms but differ on MacOS where libraries are .dylib and modules
   are .so.

TeleSculptor Application

 * Removed an unused signal/slot connection that was generating warnings on
   the command line.  Neither the signal nor the slot existed.

 * Fixed a visualization bug in which a frame with an invalid camera was still
   rendered in the world view by borrowing the camera from the most recently
   displayed valid frame.

 * Fixed a visualization bug in which camera frustums were not rendered when
   built with GCC with compiler optimizations turned on.
