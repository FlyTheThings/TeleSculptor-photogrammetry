MAP-Tk Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Switched the iso-surfacing algorithm to
   [flying edges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7348069).

 * Rebranded "MAP-Tk TeleSculptor" to simply "TeleSculptor".  These changes
   apply mostly to documentation and user-facing names.  The name "maptk"
   is still used heavily in the code itself.

 * Placing ground control points in the view uses a smart guess initial position
   method. When placing points in the world view, a point placer is used which
   snaps the point to a nearby landmark or the ground plane. When placing points
   in the camera view, the depth of the 3D point in the world view is determined
   by picking along the active camera direction vector for landmarks or the
   ground plane.

 * We now recompute the geographic origin whenever the landmarks are updated.
   This keeps the ground plane aligned with the data.

 * Use robust bounds fit to the landmarks when setting or resetting the ROI.

 * Added a new ruler measurement for measuring the distance between two points
   in the view. The ruler measurement displays two synchronized rulers between
   the world and camera view. Placing the end-points of the ruler also uses the
   smart guess initial position approach employed by ground control points.

 * The default state of the depth map and volume visibility in the World View
   is now "visible".  So you no longer need to turn them on manually to see
   these results.

 * Set the default surface threshold to 0.0 (instead of 0.5) as it should be
   and set the spin box increments to 0.1.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Increased the number of significant digits used to 12 when writing the camera
   parameters to a krtd file with the Blender plugin.

 * The camera path was not showing since the upgrade to VTK 8, now it is.

 * Camera scaling had been broken since it relied on camera path, which was
   broken.  Fixing the camera path rendering also fixed this.  Also adjusted
   the camera scaling range to make it more reasonable.

 * Fixed a crash in the GUI that occured when the video reader plugin returned
   a nullptr instead of a valid frame.

 * Switched from calling get_image() in a loop during the depth_to_vtk function to
   outside the loop.  This improves processing speed by eliminating unnecessary
   image allocations for certain underlying image classes.

 * Fixed the volume surface mesh to use a solid color when not in colorize mode
   previously the color would change with the surface threshold.

 * Fixed the colorize checkbox for the volume to return the model to solid color
   when unchecked.
