Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * Switched the iso-surfacing algorithm to
   [flying edges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7348069).

 * Rebranded "MAP-Tk TeleSculptor" to simply "TeleSculptor".  These changes
   apply mostly to documentation and user-facing names.  The name "maptk"
   is still used heavily in the code itself.

 * Placing ground control points in the view uses a smart guess initial position
   method. When placing points in the world view, a point placer is used which
   snaps the point to a nearby landmark or the ground plane. When placing points
   in the camera view, the depth of the 3D point in the world view is determined
   by picking along the active camera direction vector for landmarks or the
   ground plane.

 * We now recompute the geographic origin whenever the landmarks are updated.
   This keeps the ground plane aligned with the data.

 * Use robust bounds fit to the landmarks when setting or resetting the ROI.
