TeleSculptor

 * Switched the iso-surfacing algorithm to
   [flying edges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7348069).

 * Placing ground control points in the view uses a smart guess initial position
   method. When placing points in the world view, a point placer is used which
   snaps the point to a nearby landmark or the ground plane. When placing points
   in the camera view, the depth of the 3D point in the world view is determined
   by picking along the active camera direction vector for landmarks or the
   ground plane.
