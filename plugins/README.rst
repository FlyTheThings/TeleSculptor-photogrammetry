This directory contains TeleSculptor plugin scripts.  These scripts are not
plugins for use within TeleSculptor.  Rather they are plugins for third-party
software to allow the third-party software to load in files produced by
TeleSculptor.

=================== ===========================================================
`Blender Plugins`_  These are plugins for the open source Blender_ 3D creation
                    suite.  These plugins allow Blender to read and write
                    cameras files in the KRTD file format used by TeleSculptor.
                    Blender plugins are written in Python and are called
                    "Add-ons".  Instructions on how to install Blender Add-ons
                    can be found `here
                    <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/preferences/addons.html>`_.

`SketchUp Plugins`_ These are plugins for the SketchUp_ 3D creation suite.
                    These plugins allow SketchUp to import a TeleSculptor config
                    file which loads images and cameras into "Photo Match" views.
                    This allows a SketchUp user to draw 3D models on top of the
                    images using camera calibration from TeleSculptor.  SketchUp
                    plugins are written in Ruby.  To install SketchUp plugins
                    follow the directions in this
                    `article <https://help.sketchup.com/en/article/38583>`_ or 
                    simply copy the folder and top-level file into the 'Plugins'
                    directory in your SketchUp installation.
